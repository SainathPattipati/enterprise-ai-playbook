**Who This Is For:**
- CIOs and technology leaders evaluating AI adoption
- Product managers building AI features
- Engineers implementing AI systems
- Enterprise architects designing AI infrastructure
- Anyone responsible for AI governance and risk management

**What Makes This Different:**
- Written by someone who has DONE this, not just studied it
- Real examples from enterprise deployments (anonymized)
- Honest about failures and what we learned
- Practical, actionable guidance over theory

## Quick Start

1. **If you're starting AI adoption:** Read [Building Your AI Roadmap](01-ai-strategy/building-ai-roadmap.md)

2. **If you're deploying to production:** Read [Model Deployment Patterns](04-mlops-production/model-deployment-patterns.md)

4. **If you're struggling with data quality:** Read [Data Quality Framework](03-data-foundation/data-quality-framework.md)

## How to Use This Playbook

- **Read linearly** if you're new to enterprise AI
- **Jump to chapters** if you have a specific problem
- **Use checklists** as reference during implementation
- **Adapt templates** to your organization's needs

## Key Principles

1. **Start with business outcomes, not technology** — Define success metrics before choosing models
2. **Build data foundations first** — 80% of AI project time is data work
3. **Fail fast in pilots** — Spend 2-4 weeks validating feasibility before major investment
4. **Governance from day one** — AI governance is easier when built in, not bolted on
5. **Document everything** — Future you will thank present you
6. **Measure impact obsessively** — If you can't measure it, you can't improve it
